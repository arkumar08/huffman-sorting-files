Huffman Compression

A Python implementation of Huffman coding, a classic algorithm for lossless data compression. This project demonstrates how to compress and decompress files using Huffman trees, while also analyzing performance metrics like compression ratio and runtime.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
  - compress.py â€“ Core compression & decompression logic:
  - Builds frequency dictionaries
  - Constructs Huffman trees
  - Encodes/decodes byte streams
  - Provides functions to compress/decompress files

ðŸš€ Features
  - Build Huffman trees from frequency dictionaries
  - Generate prefix-free Huffman codes for symbols
  - Compress text and binary files into .huf format
  - Decompress .huf files back to original
  - Report compression ratio, runtime, and correctness checks
  - Supports arbitrary binary files (e.g., .bmp images tested in this project)


ðŸ“Š Example Output
Processing: files/parrot.bmp
Compression Time: 0.0542 seconds
Decompression Time: 0.0391 seconds
Original Size: 307,254 bytes
Compressed Size: 198,745 bytes
Decompressed Size: 307,254 bytes
Compression Ratio: 64.72%
âœ… SUCCESS: parrot.bmp decompressed correctly.

ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings
  - Implemented tree-based algorithms in Python
  - Worked with binary data and bit-level operations
  - Practiced algorithm analysis with time complexity and compression ratio
  - Reinforced skills in data structures, recursion, and file I/O
